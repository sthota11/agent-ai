# Agent AI: Projects with OpenAI

This repository is a collection of simple, beginner-friendly Node.js projects, each demonstrating how to build an "agent" using the OpenAI API.  
Every agent performs a different, useful task—perfect for learning, experimenting, and understanding how AI fits into real-world JavaScript apps!

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

You’ll find **three mini-projects (agents):**

### 1. Weather Agent

Fetches the current weather for any city or location using the OpenAI API and a weather service.  
Great for learning how to call APIs and use AI for practical outputs.

### 2. Code Generator Agent (Similar to Cursor AI IDE)

Acts like a mini AI IDE!  
Generates code, creates simple starter projects, and helps automate programming tasks, powered by OpenAI.  
Inspired by tools like Cursor, but kept easy and beginner-friendly.

### 3. Postgres Todo Agent

A basic todo app that connects to a Postgres database.  
Lets you add, update, or list todos using natural language—OpenAI interprets your commands and interacts with the database.
